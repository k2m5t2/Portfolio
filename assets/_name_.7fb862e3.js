Although the HCI functions that can be made possible by using EMG are endless, it is not easy to find online articles dealing with EMG hardware and software development from an engineering point of view, even major books, so developers have to look into the papers themselves. Companies selling medical EMG hardware (i.e., Biometrics Ltd.) are usually expensive and far from open source, and cheap hobbyist-grade hardware (i.e., MyoWare) has poor performance and is also not open source. It is difficult to include in home-made hardware.

Even if you reduce it to 25 buttons that are actually in charge of language, the number of possible combinations is far fewer. So, tap multiple fingers at once to expand the number of digits.
