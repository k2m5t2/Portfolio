### WristLets

This prototype was inspired by Jung et al.'s wearable modular haptic patch. It is a device made of flexible PCB that wraps around the wrist and is used for object finding assistance through directional haptic patterns.

## How

### TipLets

Each unit contains six `DRV2605` haptic motor drivers and a rechargeable coin cell battery on a small 30mm * 40mm board, and is composed of a commercial ESP32 board that is connected in a shield form and is responsible for calculation and wireless communication. From idea drafting, component selection, circuit design, PCB artwork, production request, and SMT assembly process were directly carried out.

### WristLets

Using the `TLC5940` 16-channel LED driver, it contains a total of 32 haptic motors across the wrist. Designed for daisy-chaining (mechanically and electrically). Therefore, if necessary, we plan to conduct various sensory replacement experiments by connecting the size of various body parts such as the waist and legs.
