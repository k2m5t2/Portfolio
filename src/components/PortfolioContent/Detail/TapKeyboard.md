This is the Korean input layout of the Tap Strap 2, designed in consideration of intuitiveness and input efficiency.

### Why

The most commonly used keyboard standard is the 108-button layout. On the other hand, the Tap Strap only measures whether each of the five fingers has been tapped. Even if you reduce it to 25 buttons that are actually in charge of language, the number of possible combinations is far fewer. So, tap multiple fingers at once to expand the number of digits. These include frequent tapping of multiple fingers for a single letter (finger fatigue), and difficulties in learning letter patterns. It was designed to solve this.

### How

I am not familiar with this project as it was a high school student with no knowledge of design methodology and user interface design. It was conceived by referring to the frequency of Hangeul graphemes analyzed in the Twitter corpus and various beautiful Korean keyboard layouts (Cheonjiin, short vowel, three-beolsik, etc.).
