### Why

I wanted to design a laser cutter/engraver that could be manufactured with minimal commercial parts (value). It requires a manufacturing cost of $200, compared to low-cost commercial diode laser cutters that start at around $400. Due to the risk of eye damage from diode lasers and the lack of laser experience, it was finished with a 2-axis lathe with whiteboard markers attached.

### How

Except for the motors, screws, 2020 aluminum, belts, and control boards, all 3D printed parts were used. The completed CAD file was open sourced to the Hackaday community.
