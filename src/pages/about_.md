  <h3>Hey there, nice to meet you!</h3>
</div>

Thanks for visiting my website. My name is Yunho Cho, and I study mechanical engineering and psychology at Georgia Institute of Technology. I hope you find my work and my story interesting. If you want to know a little more about me, read on below or get in touch!

I'm an engineer who's passionate about many many things in the world, including: `mechanical systems`, `software`, `AI`, `human-computer interaction`, `psychology`, `design theory`, `interactive artworks`, `3D graphics`, `origami`, `music & instruments`, `spatial audio`, and `photography`. 

In my free time, I watch documentaries, think about things, ride the bike, climb some rocks, read, write, plan out the coming weeks, and majestically procrastinate while doom-scrolling through Instagram. Thanks for visiting ‚Äì and feel free to reach out!
