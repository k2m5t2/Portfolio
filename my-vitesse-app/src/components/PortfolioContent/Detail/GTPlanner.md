Undergraduate course planning aid and visualization website for students in Georgia Tech

### Why

For college students, registering for classes is like a war. But it doesn't end there. The process of planning the courses to take for the next 1-2 years is just as agonizing as the course registration itself. With the intertwined relationship between prerequisite courses and various other variables (availability of classes by season, exchange student schedule, professor review, practical difficulty of lectures, etc.) You will go through many experiences. Unfortunately, undergraduate students are engulfed in these concerns during the season right before the end of the semester when they are busy studying. We started developing it so that students can plan a better life.

### How

Graphviz graph creation library and JavaScript interface, d3-Graphviz, are implemented as main axes. We use Vue for basic frontend functionality. We use Python, FastAPI, and MongoDB for web crawling and data analysis. In the fall of 2022, it will be launched as a student council IT committee project, and a team will be formed to begin development in earnest.
